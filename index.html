			<h2>Welcome</h2>
			<p>
				Hello and welcome to my website! I made this in September 2018 as an assignment for <a href="https://www.adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developers Academy</a>. Enjoy!
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently working on: ...THIS WEBSITE. And learning how to become a software developer. Next up: ~RAILS~.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now for some Lorem Ipsum: These Happy Days are yours and mine Happy Days., But they got diff'rent strokes. It takes diff'rent strokes - it takes diff'rent strokes to move the world. Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale a tale of a fateful trip that started from this tropic port aboard this tiny ship. These days are all Happy and Free. These days are all share them with me oh baby. Makin' your way in the world today takes everything you've got. Takin' a break from all your worries sure would help a lot. All of them had hair of gold like their mother the youngest one in curls. The first mate and his Skipper too will do their very best to make the others comfortable in their tropic island nest. No phone no lights no motor car not a single luxury. Like Robinson Crusoe it's primitive as can be. Well we're movin' on up to the east side. To a deluxe apartment in the sky. Straightnin' the curves. Flatnin' the hills Someday the mountain might get ‘em but the law never will. Didn't need no welfare states. Everybody pulled his weight. Gee our old Lasalle ran great. Those were the days.
			</p>

			<p>
				Just two good ol' boys Wouldn't change if they could. Fightin' the system like a true modern day Robin Hood. And when the odds are against him and their dangers work to do. You bet your life Speed Racer he will see it through.
